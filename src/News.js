              <h4>BLOOD HARMONY IS OUT OCTOBER 22ND!</h4>
              <p>
                I am so thrilled to let you all know first that my fifth record,
                Blood Harmony, is finished. It is being pressed on vinyl and CD,
                is available digitally as well, and will be out in the world
                October 22nd. As I’ve mentioned, this record is our first on our
                own label. Tim and I get to call all the shots so if we want to
                leak the news a day early, we can. I have so many more updates
                so let’s get to it. First, we have a brand new store that you
                can go to HERE. It lets our American fans pay with dollars, our
                European fans pay with euros, and everybody gets their
                merchandise shipped from their own continent. If you’re in North
                or South America, Tim will be personally sending it your way
                straight from Philly. If you’re in Europe, Asia, or Australia
                our dear friend Susan who runs the fantastic RANKERS page will
                be shipping it. Now that we’re our own label, we get to keep
                everything in the family, and that includes you. The fun starts
                on Friday when the first single, “Sandy Sheets,” is out in the
                world. You can pre-save it HERE. Now that we’re the label, we
                have to ask people to do that. Please forgive us. Over the next
                weeks and months, I am so stoked to tell you all about the
                making of the record, introduce you to the amazing people who
                played it with me, but most of all, share this music with you as
                we are so proud of it.

            <h4>EUROPEAN TOUR 2022 AND RESOLUTIONS VOL. 1</h4>
            <p>
              Hey y’all, greetings from California! SO… by this time next month,
              Tim and I will have finished recording my fifth record. That’s
              right. After a year of being off the road, and close to 2.5 years
              since we went in to record Kick, we are heading to Nashville at
              the end of the week to record a batch of songs we are really proud
              of. I’ll have more details for you as soon as we finish it. The
              when and the where and the how of getting it, but I can tell you
              that for the first time, we are officially putting it out
              ourselves, on our own record label. Nobody telling us when we can
              put out records, nobody saying “I don’t hear a single,” no
              marketing ideas that don’t 100% come from us. It’s all ours, and
              we are so excited. Speaking of excitement, I am thrilled to
              announce that we will be returning to Europe for a headline tour
              next year! The Mermaid and I will be back and ready to play the
              new songs and all your other favorites. Now, as a thank you for
              reading this each month, you are the only people who know this
              right now. Later today, there will be a fancy announcement but for
              now, you can go HERE and get tickets before anyone else. Make sure
              you click on Pre-Sale. Some of these venues are tiny so they’ll go
              quick. Now, while we have TONS of new stuff on the horizon,
              there’s a vault full of goodies, and Bandcamp Friday us today!
              Back in January, I got to celebrate the tenth anniversary of my
              debut album, Resolutions, with my little guitar collection and all
              of you. There are some fun versions: “Melanin” on 12-string,
              “Prague” on the ukulele, “Another Town” by Steve Earle, and the
              first time for Americans that “Play It By Ear” has been made
              available (other than for free on via YouTube rascals). You can
              get Vol. 1 of the show HERE. That’s it for now. It seems like
              things are starting to come back online slowly in America, and our
              plans for releasing Album 5 and touring on it won’t really start
              till September/October as it stands now. Singles, pre-orders,
              merch and all of that jazz will be coming in July. Meantime, if
              you have gotten this far, could you do me a kindness and follow
              our Spotify and YouTube pages? I know, I know, most of you have
              already signed up, but if you haven’t, it helps more than you
              know! Thanks y’all. We are almost there. Keep the faith. Peace &
              Love

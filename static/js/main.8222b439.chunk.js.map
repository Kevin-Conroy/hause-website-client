<h1>Bio</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n          On a base level, the term ‘blood harmony’ is simple—it describes the\r\n          specific sound two siblings make when they sing together. Given that\r\n          Dave Hause has been writing and recording songs with his younger\r\n          brother Tim for a while now, it made sense to use that phrase as the\r\n          title for his fifth solo record. But this being a Dave Hause album\r\n          also means there’s much more to it than that. Beneath the surface of\r\n          Blood Harmony, in fact, are multiple layers of meaning relating to\r\n          Hause’s role as a musician, a brother, a husband, a son and—having\r\n          become a father to twins a few months before the release of 2019’s\r\n          Kick—a dad. As such, Blood Harmony is also a reassertion of what\r\n          family means to him. Even more so because it’s coming out on the label\r\n          owned by he and his brother. “I thought Blood Harmony was a great\r\n          title” says Hause, “and really specific to how Tim and I have decided\r\n          to work over the years. It also pertains to my children because\r\n          they’ll have their own Blood Harmony. So the germ of the album, the\r\n          beating heart, is that I’m in a true family. I have a grounded reason\r\n          to work and a bunch of people that I want to make proud with the work\r\n          that we do. It’s a family business.” The importance of that was made\r\n          all the more apparent after the coronavirus outbreak. Hause, with his\r\n          brother, used that unexpected downtime to make the Patty/Paddy tribute\r\n          EPs to Patty Griffin and Dillinger Four’s Patrick ‘Paddy’ Costello.\r\n          After a while, though, like all touring musicians, he found himself\r\n          without an income. So when his friend and former manager offered him\r\n          some work nearby as a Covid safety supervisor for the company she set\r\n          up after contracting Covid herself, he said yes. It was for one of the\r\n          biggest celebrities in the world, so to prepare, Hause went to LA and\r\n          worked on two shoots with two of music’s biggest stars. He was shocked\r\n          at the scant disregard their teams had for their well-being. “These\r\n          artists are so successful they never need to work again,” says Hause,\r\n          “but the label and management were pushing to get away with stuff and\r\n          it was totally unsafe. I was pretty disgusted seeing the industry at\r\n          that level, and how much of it was simply greed and not caring about\r\n          the safety of others. We were just starting to roll out the EPs on our\r\n          own label, and the whole experience just ironed my resolve—I’m a\r\n          family artist, and I never want to be in a position where people are\r\n          urging me to do things that are bad for my or my family’s mental or\r\n          physical health. That’s not what it’s about for me. It’s about\r\n          connection. So that experience really reinforced this idea of blood\r\n          harmony. I’m connected to my people, and this is a small little thing\r\n          that we’re going to keep pure.” You can hear Hause’s passion and\r\n          dedication to his craft—as well as his determined approach to\r\n          it—flowing through the veins of Blood Harmony’s ten stunning,\r\n          sumptuous songs. Written with his brother over a series of weekly\r\n          FaceTime sessions, they began crafting songs together in January 2021.\r\n          They’d been writing remotely together since 2017’s Bury Me In Philly\r\n          so it wasn’t an entirely new process for them, but they modified their\r\n          approach slightly by giving themselves rigid deadlines. “We decided to\r\n          get together on Mondays,” explains Hause, “to figure out what we\r\n          wanted to work on, and by Friday we had to have something you could\r\n          sing to someone who wasn’t a songwriter. It could be bad, but I didn’t\r\n          want to just have vague ideas. We called it ‘Pencils-Down Fridays’.\r\n          Over the course of three-and-a-half months, we ended up with 26\r\n          songs.” They traveled with ten of those to Nashville, where acclaimed\r\n          songwriter Will Hoge took up the helm of producer. Through Hoge’s\r\n          connections, what Hause calls “a staggering bunch of musicians” was\r\n          assembled to flesh out the songs he and Tim had written. He’s not\r\n          wrong. There was Brandi Carlile’s drummer Chris Powell, Bruce\r\n          Springsteen And The E Street band bassist Garry Tallent, acclaimed\r\n          session guitarist Tom Bukovac, Jason Isbell’s guitarist Sadler Vaden,\r\n          and keyboardist Billy Justineau, Mike Webb, and Jen Gunderman, who\r\n          have played with the likes of Eric Church, Sheryl Crow, and more.\r\n          Hause is the first to admit that it was a world away from the punk\r\n          rock scene he’d made his name with as frontman of The Loved Ones.\r\n          “They say that when you work in any field, you’re happiest when you\r\n          initially get the respect of your peers,” he says. “Thankfully, I’ve\r\n          had that respect for some time now. But in this situation, these\r\n          people were not our peers. They’ve operated at the highest level of\r\n          the music business that is even possible, so to get their respect was\r\n          so gratifying. Their kindness and commitment to making the record\r\n          great because they liked the songs was tremendous. I keep saying that\r\n          if anybody else likes the record, that’s icing on the cake, because\r\n          the way we wrote and made it was so wonderful.” While nobody would say\r\n          the quality of Hause’s previous albums was lacking, making Blood\r\n          Harmony with those musicians was nevertheless a concerted effort to\r\n          ramp it up. And it does. It begins with “Northstar”, a tender paean to\r\n          the direction, comfort and joy his wife and twins have given him that\r\n          also drives home the emotional resonance and sense of family at the\r\n          center of this album. It’s followed immediately by “Sandy Sheets”, a\r\n          nostalgic trip into a past long-gone that references the Gin Blossoms’\r\n          “Hey Jealousy” in its chorus, and which sounds every bit as iconic as\r\n          that track. The gorgeous, lilting, paradise of “Hanalai” captures that\r\n          rare sense of peace when you’re with the person you love and nothing\r\n          else matters, “Surfboard” injects some rare, good-natured humor into\r\n          the trials and tribulations of being working class—something that\r\n          remains, as ever, an undercurrent here—while “Carry The Lantern” and\r\n          its life-affirming, almost Thin Lizzy-esque riffs double down Hause’s\r\n          commitment to his sobriety and his family. “A lot of being an adult\r\n          for me is recommitting to your better angels instead of chasing your\r\n          own tail,” he says. “That song is about facing temptation but\r\n          redoubling your efforts to stay committed to the higher things that\r\n          compel us to be better.” It’s followed by the gorgeous album closer\r\n          “Little Wings”. Hause calls it a post-script, but it resonates much\r\n          more deeply and feels more significant than that. In fact, it ends the\r\n          album the same way it begins—with a tender song for and about his\r\n          twins that’s full of the purest love and hope. It’s impossible to not\r\n          hear and feel just how much they and his whole family—that beating\r\n          heart at the center of these songs—mean to him. It’s a truly beautiful\r\n          thing.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </main>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Bio;\r\n","import React from \"react\"\r\n\r\nclass Releases extends React.Component {\r\n    componentDidMount(){\r\n        window.location.href = \"https://lnk.to/iAZWYUje\";\r\n     }\r\n   \r\n     render() {\r\n       return (\r\n         <div>\r\n          <h2>Redirecting...</h2>\r\n         </div>\r\n       )\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   export default Releases;","import React from \"react\"\r\n\r\nfunction Follow() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>Find me on MySpace \\m/ \\m/</h1>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Follow","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./App.css\";\r\n\r\nclass ArchiveDateListing extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <main className=\"box\">\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h5>{this.props.archivedate.year}</h5>\r\n          <h5>{this.props.archivedate.venue}</h5>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </main>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ArchiveDateListing;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ArchiveDateListing from \"./ArchiveDateListing\";\r\n\r\nclass Archive extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      archivedates: [],\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    fetch(`http://localhost:8000/archive/2017`)\r\n      .then((response) => response.json())\r\n      .then((archivedates) => {\r\n        this.setState({ archivedates });\r\n      });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h2>Archive</h2>\r\n        {this.state.archivedates.map((archivedate) => {\r\n          return <ArchiveDateListing archivedate={archivedate} />;\r\n        })}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Archive","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass News extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <main>\r\n          <h1 className=\"text-center\">News</h1>\r\n          <div className=\"box\">\r\n            <div>\r\n              <h4>BLOOD HARMONY IS OUT OCTOBER 22ND!</h4>\r\n              <p>\r\n                I am so thrilled to let you all know first that my fifth record,\r\n                Blood Harmony, is finished. It is being pressed on vinyl and CD,\r\n                is available digitally as well, and will be out in the world\r\n                October 22nd. As I’ve mentioned, this record is our first on our\r\n                own label. Tim and I get to call all the shots so if we want to\r\n                leak the news a day early, we can. I have so many more updates\r\n                so let’s get to it. First, we have a brand new store that you\r\n                can go to HERE. It lets our American fans pay with dollars, our\r\n                European fans pay with euros, and everybody gets their\r\n                merchandise shipped from their own continent. If you’re in North\r\n                or South America, Tim will be personally sending it your way\r\n                straight from Philly. If you’re in Europe, Asia, or Australia\r\n                our dear friend Susan who runs the fantastic RANKERS page will\r\n                be shipping it. Now that we’re our own label, we get to keep\r\n                everything in the family, and that includes you. The fun starts\r\n                on Friday when the first single, “Sandy Sheets,” is out in the\r\n                world. You can pre-save it HERE. Now that we’re the label, we\r\n                have to ask people to do that. Please forgive us. Over the next\r\n                weeks and months, I am so stoked to tell you all about the\r\n                making of the record, introduce you to the amazing people who\r\n                played it with me, but most of all, share this music with you as\r\n                we are so proud of it.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"box\">\r\n            <h4>EUROPEAN TOUR 2022 AND RESOLUTIONS VOL. 1</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Hey y’all, greetings from California! SO… by this time next month,\r\n              Tim and I will have finished recording my fifth record. That’s\r\n              right. After a year of being off the road, and close to 2.5 years\r\n              since we went in to record Kick, we are heading to Nashville at\r\n              the end of the week to record a batch of songs we are really proud\r\n              of. I’ll have more details for you as soon as we finish it. The\r\n              when and the where and the how of getting it, but I can tell you\r\n              that for the first time, we are officially putting it out\r\n              ourselves, on our own record label. Nobody telling us when we can\r\n              put out records, nobody saying “I don’t hear a single,” no\r\n              marketing ideas that don’t 100% come from us. It’s all ours, and\r\n              we are so excited. Speaking of excitement, I am thrilled to\r\n              announce that we will be returning to Europe for a headline tour\r\n              next year! The Mermaid and I will be back and ready to play the\r\n              new songs and all your other favorites. Now, as a thank you for\r\n              reading this each month, you are the only people who know this\r\n              right now. Later today, there will be a fancy announcement but for\r\n              now, you can go HERE and get tickets before anyone else. Make sure\r\n              you click on Pre-Sale. Some of these venues are tiny so they’ll go\r\n              quick. Now, while we have TONS of new stuff on the horizon,\r\n              there’s a vault full of goodies, and Bandcamp Friday us today!\r\n              Back in January, I got to celebrate the tenth anniversary of my\r\n              debut album, Resolutions, with my little guitar collection and all\r\n              of you. There are some fun versions: “Melanin” on 12-string,\r\n              “Prague” on the ukulele, “Another Town” by Steve Earle, and the\r\n              first time for Americans that “Play It By Ear” has been made\r\n              available (other than for free on via YouTube rascals). You can\r\n              get Vol. 1 of the show HERE. That’s it for now. It seems like\r\n              things are starting to come back online slowly in America, and our\r\n              plans for releasing Album 5 and touring on it won’t really start\r\n              till September/October as it stands now. Singles, pre-orders,\r\n              merch and all of that jazz will be coming in July. Meantime, if\r\n              you have gotten this far, could you do me a kindness and follow\r\n              our Spotify and YouTube pages? I know, I know, most of you have\r\n              already signed up, but if you haven’t, it helps more than you\r\n              know! Thanks y’all. We are almost there. Keep the faith.

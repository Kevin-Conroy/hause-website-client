Given that Dave Hause has been writing and recording songs with his younger brother Tim for a while now, it made sense to use that phrase as the title for his fifth solo record. But this being a Dave Hause album also means there\u2019s much more to it than that. Beneath the surface of Blood Harmony, in fact, are multiple layers of meaning relating to Hause\u2019s role as a musician, a brother, a husband, a son and\u2014having become a father to twins a few months before the release of 2019\u2019s Kick\u2014a dad. As such, Blood Harmony is also a reassertion of what family means to him. Even more so because it\u2019s coming out on the label owned by he and his brother. \u201cI thought Blood Harmony was a great title\u201d says Hause, \u201cand really specific to how Tim and I have decided to work over the years. It also pertains to my children because they\u2019ll have their own Blood Harmony. So the germ of the album, the beating heart, is that I\u2019m in a true family. I have a grounded reason to work and a bunch of people that I want to make proud with the work that we do. It\u2019s a family business.\u201d The importance of that was made all the more apparent after the coronavirus outbreak. Hause, with his brother, used that unexpected downtime to make the Patty/Paddy tribute EPs to Patty Griffin and Dillinger Four\u2019s Patrick \u2018Paddy\u2019 Costello. After a while, though, like all touring musicians, he found himself without an income. So when his friend and former manager offered him some work nearby as a Covid safety supervisor for the company she set up after contracting Covid herself, he said yes. It was for one of the biggest celebrities in the world, so to prepare, Hause went to LA and worked on two shoots with two of music\u2019s biggest stars. He was shocked at the scant disregard their teams had for their well-being. \u201cThese artists are so successful they never need to work again,\u201d says Hause, \u201cbut the label and management were pushing to get away with stuff and it was totally unsafe. I was pretty disgusted seeing the industry at that level, and how much of it was simply greed and not caring about the safety of others. We were just starting to roll out the EPs on our own label, and the whole experience just ironed my resolve\u2014I\u2019m a family artist, and I never want to be in a position where people are urging me to do things that are bad for my or my family\u2019s mental or physical health. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about for me. It\u2019s about connection. So that experience really reinforced this idea of blood harmony. I\u2019m connected to my people, and this is a small little thing that we\u2019re going to keep pure.\u201d You can hear Hause\u2019s passion and dedication to his craft\u2014as well as his determined approach to it\u2014flowing through the veins of Blood Harmony\u2019s ten stunning, sumptuous songs. Written with his brother over a series of weekly FaceTime sessions, they began crafting songs together in January 2021. They\u2019d been writing remotely together since 2017\u2019s Bury Me In Philly so it wasn\u2019t an entirely new process for them, but they modified their approach slightly by giving themselves rigid deadlines. \u201cWe decided to get together on Mondays,\u201d explains Hause, \u201cto figure out what we wanted to work on, and by Friday we had to have something you could sing to someone who wasn\u2019t a songwriter. It could be bad, but I didn\u2019t want to just have vague ideas. We called it \u2018Pencils-Down Fridays\u2019. Over the course of three-and-a-half months, we ended up with 26 songs.\u201d They traveled with ten of those to Nashville, where acclaimed songwriter Will Hoge took up the helm of producer. Through Hoge\u2019s connections, what Hause calls \u201ca staggering bunch of musicians\u201d was assembled to flesh out the songs he and Tim had written. He\u2019s not wrong. There was Brandi Carlile\u2019s drummer Chris Powell, Bruce Springsteen And The E Street band bassist Garry Tallent, acclaimed session guitarist Tom Bukovac, Jason Isbell\u2019s guitarist Sadler Vaden, and keyboardist Billy Justineau, Mike Webb, and Jen Gunderman, who have played with the likes of Eric Church, Sheryl Crow, and more. Hause is the first to admit that it was a world away from the punk rock scene he\u2019d made his name with as frontman of The Loved Ones. \u201cThey say that when you work in any field, you\u2019re happiest when you initially get the respect of your peers,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully, I\u2019ve had that respect for some time now. But in this situation, these people were not our peers. They\u2019ve operated at the highest level of the music business that is even possible, so to get their respect was so gratifying. Their kindness and commitment to making the record great because they liked the songs was tremendous. I keep saying that if anybody else likes the record, that\u2019s icing on the cake, because the way we wrote and made it was so wonderful.\u201d While nobody would say the quality of Hause\u2019s previous albums was lacking, making Blood Harmony with those musicians was nevertheless a concerted effort to ramp it up. And it does. It begins with \u201cNorthstar\u201d, a tender paean to the direction, comfort and joy his wife and twins have given him that also drives home the emotional resonance and sense of family at the center of this album. It\u2019s followed immediately by \u201cSandy Sheets\u201d, a nostalgic trip into a past long-gone that references the Gin Blossoms\u2019 \u201cHey Jealousy\u201d in its chorus, and which sounds every bit as iconic as that track. The gorgeous, lilting, paradise of \u201cHanalai\u201d captures that rare sense of peace when you\u2019re with the person you love and nothing else matters, \u201cSurfboard\u201d injects some rare, good-natured humor into the trials and tribulations of being working class\u2014something that remains, as ever, an undercurrent here\u2014while \u201cCarry The Lantern\u201d and its life-affirming, almost Thin Lizzy-esque riffs double down Hause\u2019s commitment to his sobriety and his family. \u201cA lot of being an adult for me is recommitting to your better angels instead of chasing your own tail,\u201d he says. \u201cThat song is about facing temptation but redoubling your efforts to stay committed to the higher things that compel us to be better.\u201d It\u2019s followed by the gorgeous album closer \u201cLittle Wings\u201d. Hause calls it a post-script, but it resonates much more deeply and feels more significant than that. In fact, it ends the album the same way it begins\u2014with a tender song for and about his twins that\u2019s full of the purest love and hope. It\u2019s impossible to not hear and feel just how much they and his whole family\u2014that beating heart at the center of these songs\u2014mean to him. It\u2019s a truly beautiful thing."})]})})})},T=function(e){Object(d.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(){return Object(l.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){window.location.href="https://lnk.to/iAZWYUje"}},{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(b.jsx)("div",{children:Object(b.jsx)("h2",{children:"Redirecting..."})})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),H=T;var N=function(e){Object(d.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(e){return Object(l.a)(this,a),t.call(this,e)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(b.jsx)("main",{className:"box",children:Object(b.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("h5",{children:this.props.archivedate.year}),Object(b.jsx)("h5",{children:this.props.archivedate.venue})]})})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),S=function(e){Object(d.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(e){var n;return Object(l.a)(this,a),(n=t.call(this,e)).state={archivedates:[]},n}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){var e=this;fetch("http://localhost:8000/archive/2017").then((function(e){return e.json()})).then((function(t){e.setState({archivedates:t})}))}},{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(b.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("h2",{children:"Archive"}),this.state.archivedates.map((function(e){return Object(b.jsx)(N,{archivedate:e})}))]})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),A=function(e){Object(d.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(e){return Object(l.a)(this,a),t.call(this,e)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(b.jsx)("div",{children:Object(b.jsxs)("main",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-center",children:"News"}),Object(b.jsx)("div",{className:"box",children:Object(b.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("h4",{children:"BLOOD HARMONY IS OUT OCTOBER 22ND!"}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{children:"I am so thrilled to let you all know first that my fifth record, Blood Harmony, is finished.
